[Amardeep Singh](http://www.lehigh.edu/~amsp/2005/09/flood-by-robert-frost-and-1927.html) writes poignantly about Katrina, quoting Frost and providing a link to an older event that this reminds people of – the Mississippi river floods of 1927. When hurricanes miss Florida, we feel happy – but not this one. No. Florida could've taken this one on better.

Amardeep's post is about fallen buildings, but Veena has a [lovely post](http://onayahuasca.blogspot.com/2005/08/on-buildings.html) about buildings still standing. If there was a better post on the Blogosphere in the last few weeks, I haven't read it.

And here's a link to a classy little blog that I came across on Blog Day. [Falstaff](http://2x3x7.blogspot.com/).
