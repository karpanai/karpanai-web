Stephen Metcalf [reviews On Beauty](http://slate.msn.com/id/2126224/) for [Slate](http://slate.msn.com), part of their [Book Blitz ](http://slate.msn.com/id/2126157/) this fall, and recommends that the Booker committee not award her the prize.

> I recommend this not because Smith isn’t richly, almost absurdly, talented—which she is—and not because On Beauty isn’t a good book, because it is.

Howard looked through his window at a lamp-post buried to its waist in snow supporting two chained-up, frozen bikes, identifiable only by the tips of their handlebars. He imagined waking up this morning and digging his bike out of the snow and riding to a proper job, the kind Belseys had had for generations, and found he couldn’t imagine it. This interested Howard, for a moment: the idea that he could no longer gauge the luxuries of his own life.*
