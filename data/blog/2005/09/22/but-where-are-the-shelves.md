Books stacked on shelves, ordered using a system whose [name is a misspelt synonym of condensation](http://www.tnrdlib.bc.ca/dewey.html). Sometimes the shelves move, scaring you to death if you are caught between two of them. There are rows of computers running MS-DOS that try to hold people off from approaching the head honcho (or one of her assistants) that knows where all the books are. Trying to find a quote from a book takes a couple of days in a brick and mortar library, but it is free. Most everyone is happy with the arrangement â€“ authors, publishers, librarians. Except readers interested in a little research.

[Online behemoth](http://print.google.com/) borrows books from a few libraries, and scans them in digitally. Finding a quote from a book takes a few milliseconds.

[Publishers hate it](http://news.zdnet.co.uk/internet/0,39020369,39199954,00.htm). [And today writers have decided they hate it too](http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,6109,1575455,00.html). Go figure.
