This could be fiction, ‘cept it happened to a friend.

> Proud software engineer listens to aunts talking on a visit to India.
> 
> “My son’s a wastrel, I don’t think he’ll finish college.”
> 
> “If he is that bad at studies, you should ask him to attend a few computer courses. He can become a software engineer.”
> 
> Proud software engineer makes hurried exit.
