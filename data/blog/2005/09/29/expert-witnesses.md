**Judge**: “*Mr. Thief, you are on trial for a very serious crime. You killed the manager of a bank, and stole a lot of gold from their safe deposit vaults. The case against you is watertight.*”

**Mr. Thief**: “*Heh.*”

**Judge**: “*Heh? That's all you have to say about it?*”

**Mr. Thief**: “*Heh is the sound of me laughing self-righteously. I would like to let you know that I didn't do it. It was an invisible man that killed the manager and stole all the gold.*”

**Judge**: “*That's bullsh.., I mean, impossible.*”

**Mr. Thief**: “[*When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.*](http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/83.html)”

**Judge**: “*You lost me there, what are you talking about?*”

**Mr. Thief**: “*Never mind, but I am sticking to my story. It was an invisible man that killed the manager and stole all the gold.*”

**Judge**: “*Invisible man? That is scientifically impossible. Do you have any witnesses?*”

**Mr. Thief**: “*As a matter of fact, I do. I would like to call [H.G Wells](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.g._wells) to the stand.*”

**Judge**: “*But he is dead, I thought. Or maybe that's [Orson Wells](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Wells)*.” Checks with someone. “*Yeah, they are both dead.*”

**Mr. Thief**: “*Too bad, I will call [Ram Gopal Verma ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram_Gopal_Verma)instead. He made a movie called [Gayab](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0414040/), and can use the scientific expertise he gained during the making of the movie to prove that invisible men are not impossible.*”

**Judge**: “*I think you might have a point there. Even if I buy that for a minute, how do you explain all the gold in your house?*”

**Mr. Thief**: “*Oh, that was stuff I produced using [alchemy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy).*”

**Judge**: “*Huh? Ok, this is becoming a farce. Alchemy is a ridiculous explanation.*”

**Mr. Thief**: “*Oh yeah? I will call [Neal Stephenson](http://www.nealstephenson.com) to the stand prove it is not that ridiculous.*”

**Judge**: “*Dude, this is tiring. What are you smoking?*”

**Mr. Thief**: “*If you must know, I read [**this**](http://books.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,16488,1580591,00.html) on my way to court this morning.*“
