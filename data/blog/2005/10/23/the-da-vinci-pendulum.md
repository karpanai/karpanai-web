> *Talking about Foucault’s Pendulum, there is a sense in which you did the Da Vinci Code before Dan Brown did. Of course, you did it as a myth that takes on a strange reality and he did it as it was historical truth.*

Umberto Eco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umberto_Eco), in [The Hindu](http://www.hindu.com/2005/10/23/stories/2005102305241000.htm). I don’t know about you, but it seems to me that Mr. Eco is claiming he is Dan Brown’s inspiration. Oh, well, Christmas is approaching and I guess people want to confess to their crimes. Good Lord, please spare Umberto. He is just a professor who writes books on Sundays.
