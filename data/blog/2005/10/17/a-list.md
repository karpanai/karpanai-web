[Time Magazine ](http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/) makes a list of the best books of this century – a list skewed towards popular literature – and me likes it very much. Le Carre makes it and so do William Gibson and Neal Stephenson. And Bellow and Roth. Very cool.

Update: [John Le Carre](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=books&field-author-exact=John%20le%20Carre&rank=-relevance%2C%2Bavailability%2C-daterank/102-3732538-4951324) has long been a personal favorite – I’d argue a bit over the book chosen to represent Le Carre in the list ([Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0743457900/qid=1129607543/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/102-3732538-4951324?v=glance&s=books) or [The Little Drummer Girl](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0743464656/qid=1129607567/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/102-3732538-4951324?v=glance&s=books) would’ve been better choices, but at least they didn’t pick [The Constant Gardener](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0743262433/qid=1129607479/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-3732538-4951324?v=glance&s=books&n=507846)), but no quibbles with him being in the list. He did the hardest thing you could ask a writer to do: making literature out of the most dumbed down fiction genre. Now if he’d only start writing codebreaking books set in the Vatican…

[William Gibson ](http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/index.asp)and [Neal Stephenson](http://www.nealstephenson.com) are much overlooked writers. Just because they write Science Fiction, the literary types sneer, hold their noses and walk away from them. But if the value of a book lies in the amount of (smart) entertainment it provides, then [NeuroMancer ](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0441569595/qid=1129607637/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/102-3732538-4951324?v=glance&s=books)and [SnowCrash](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0553380958/ref=pd_bbs_null_1/102-3732538-4951324?v=glance&s=books) are right up there with the best. [Cryptonomicon](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060512806/ref=pd_bbs_null_3/102-3732538-4951324?v=glance&s=books) too, but I’ll live with this.
