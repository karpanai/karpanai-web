 A Vairamuthu interview to kick off the day. First the good news. [Vairamuthu is not writing for Rajinikanth's Chandramukhi.](http://www.thatstamil.com/specials/cinema/interview/vairamuthu.html) But he says, every “micro-second” of his life contains poetry. Like [so:](http://www.thatstamil.com/specials/cinema/shooting-spot/shriya.html)

> “Princess of Istanbul (!)  
> Heat up the land with your kisses” (from Mazhai)

He talks warmly about Illayaraja, I think. It is kinda hard to figure out what the man is trying to say. And he also says something about talking to Rahman being a “pleasure.” Says their next project is Godfather starring Al Pacino and Asin.

And [Rajinikanth](http://www.thatstamil.com/images26/cinema/rajinik-300.jpg)? What can I say? Perhaps just a bad wig day.

Meanwhile, Balu Mahendra [ agonizes ](http://www.thatstamil.com/specials/cinema/interview/balumahendra.html) over good directors (read : him) not being treated right by Tamil cinema. Poignant story about him talking about salaries with other directors, and realizing belatedly that they were talking in millions, not thousands. I used to like him a lot, but he seems to be stuck in a rut these days.
