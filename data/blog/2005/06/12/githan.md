We watched Jithan (a Tamil movie, for the uninitiated) over the weekend. It's a remake of Gayab (a Hindi movie, God you are really uninitiated aren't you?), and if you trace the inspiration tree you'll end up at H.G. Wells. Kinda like Revenge of the Invisible Nerd.

So anyways, the movie had music by Srikanth Deva, son of the legendary music composer Deva (snicker); and I was inspired to write a detailed, analytical review of the soundtrack. So, here goes.

Excrement.
