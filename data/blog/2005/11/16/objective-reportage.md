![Vijay, the hero](../../../../uploads/sivakasi.jpg)I have been called a [DUMD ASS(sic)](https://stochastica.net/2005/10/21/simile-you-are-on-camera/#comments) on this very blog by an irate commentor that thought I was being snotty when talking about Indian movies. Now to be honest with you, one part of my brain would like me to think the commentor was a nubile young lady who had very, very strong feelings for me. But y'all know this quite well: I am a realist and such balderdash cannot delude me that easily. I will readily concede that her feelings for me weren't very, very strong.

So anyways, in deference to my secret (but not very strong) admirer, I will restrict myself to a strictly objective, factual reportage about this movie called Sivakasi. It is in Tamil, and it stars an actor called [Vijay](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0897201/). What? Ok, sure. I will defer to the spirit of this report (objective, factual) and revise the last sentence. It is in Tamil, and it stars a person called Vijay.

**Close Shaves:**

A group of people headed by a guy called Palanquin Pandi surround another group of people. After a series of scuffles, Palanquin Pandi's group reveals their motive – they want to know who heads the other group of people. “Fairly easy question,” I thought to myself. Regular movie watchers know what would happen next: The hero will come up to Palanquin and punch him a few times, and then look at the cameraman and inform him that he heads the group, and owns their hearts. Cue a song.

Now imagine my horror when the scene unfolded differently – someone that did not look like Vijay at all duly stepped forward, applied generous amounts of ash on his head and moved his hands up and down. “This guy, hero?”, “Oh no!”, “What the ..” were the thoughts that ran through my mind. The guy then used several long sentences and clever placement of a title card to inform the cameraman that the hero was wise and strong and that he was the director of the movie. I am not sure Palanquin got the point, but I heaved a sigh of relief. Phew.

**What happens to the losers on Jeopardy?**

Dad A complains to Dad B that Dad B's son tried to rape his daughter. Dad B is very angry, and tries to beat up his son with a stout object. After a couple of blows that didn't land that well, Dad B asks his son if he is indeed his son. The bemused son asks the dad to check with his mom. Unable to stand this question, dad promptly dies. Hard questions can kill.

![](../../../../uploads/sivakasi2.jpg)**What a total waist?**

Music Director Srikanth Deva in a cameo appearance shakes his enormous waist to the beats of Maama Un Ponnai Kodu, an old Illayaraja number.

Actress [Nayanthara](http://images.google.com/images?sourceid=navclient-ff&ie=UTF-8&rls=GGGL,GGGL:2005-09,GGGL:en&q=nayanthara&sa=N&tab=wi) in a cameo appearance shakes her enormous waist to the beats of a song I can't remember. Coming to think of it, I am not even sure it was a song, but the waist was enormous. She is now a [cabalite](https://stochastica.net/2005/03/20/rear-ending-into-submission/).

**Best Song in the Movie:**

Music Director Srikanth Deva in a cameo appearance shakes his enormous waist to the beats of Maama Un Ponnai Kodu, an old Illayaraja number.

The rap-like song (wanna, shake it, s to the i to the blah) that plays in the background. Music can be mirthful too.

**Movies can educate too:**

A male human being is defined as someone that:

a. Falls in Love with a girl.  
b. Marries the girl.  
c. Sleeps with the girl.

Any change in the order of events is not acceptable. What will happen to such people though? I want to ask someone, but I am afraid it might be a hard question.

**Chicks will dig this:**

Several (male) actors show off their thighs during fight sequences. I even detected a glimpse (or three) of undergarments. Sorry, no thongs though.

**Biggest expense item:**

The amount of ash purchased for the movie. The good guys show their goodness by applying generous amounts of it on their foreheads.

**Second biggest expense item:**

The amount of kum-kum purchased for the movie. The good guys show their goodness by applying generous amounts of it on their foreheads.

**Dialogues heard the most:**

“Start the car!”

“Beat that guy!”

**Decrease most noticeable:**

Quantity of clothes worn by Asin over the last few movies.

**Increase most noticeable:**

The number of times Vijay speaks to the cameraman. They must be close friends.

**Optimism:**

Majaa will be better. Surely.

**Impossible:**

The opinion of my dad – reliable critic, born, brought up and living in India still. Both movies are bad, Majaa is a tad worse. Such depths exist?
