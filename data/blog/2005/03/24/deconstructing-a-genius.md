The [Indian Express](http://www.indianexpress.com) [ reports](http://www.indianexpress.com/full_story.php?content_id=66357) that [George Andrews](http://www.math.psu.edu/andrews/) and [Bruce Berndt](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~berndt/) (associate editor of the [Ramanujan journal](http://grove.ufl.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/~fgarvan/ram_csh.cgi)) are on the verge of releasing a decrypted version of the first of [Srinivasa Ramanujan's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramanujan) famous [Lost Notebooks](http://www.flonnet.com/fl1617/16170810.htm).

Link through [SepiaMutiny](http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/001231.html) : An exhaustive post that provides a lot of background about the great man. Genius is an overused word these days, but he was the real thing. Pity that he died so early.
