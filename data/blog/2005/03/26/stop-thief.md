This is more up [Manoj's](http://www.minorscale.net) alley, but the plagiarism is so glaringly obvious here that the moment I listened to the song all I could say was, *Ada paavi!* (or Holy Crap!)

[Prema Prema](/pictures/prema.rm), by Chakri from the Telugu movie Kabaddi Kabaddi, ~ circa 2004.

[Poovarasampoo](/pictures/poovarasampoo.rm), by [Ilaiyaraaja ](http://www.raaja.com)from Kizhakke Pogum Rail, Tamil, ~circa 1980.

*Ada Paavi!*
