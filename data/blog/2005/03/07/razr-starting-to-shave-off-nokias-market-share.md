Finally, Motorola is starting to generate some [positive buzz](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7102433/site/newsweek/). The Razr is like the coolest cellphone ever â€“ the iPod of cellphones.

> For example, Motorola execs talk of a forthcoming music phone within the Razr family, Rockr, that might recognize songs being played in a club, let users download them to their phones and then send them home to their cable boxes and stereos. That would definitely be cool, and for Motorola, that's the goal.
