Marilynne Robinson's [Gilead ](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0374153892/qid=1111264640/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/103-5173162-5662268?v=glance&s=books&n=507846)bags the [Book Critic's](http://www.bookcritic.org) award for fiction. Going by the amount of acclaim it is getting, (it was already on everyone's[ list of best books of 2004](https://stochastica.net/?p=97), ) Gilead might just jump to the start of my reading list.
