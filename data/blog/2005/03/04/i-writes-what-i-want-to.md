Non-native English speakers apparently outnumber “native” speakers 3 to 1 now. As a consequence, [this article](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7038031/site/newsweek/) says, common mistakes like “She look very sad” might become acceptable usage.

Me thinks pronunciation compromises are ok, but not grammar and structure changes. But then again, I just said “me thinks”, so my words don't mean nothing much.
