I can get enough time this year to read all of these: [Ten Best books of 2004](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/12/books/review/12TENBEST.html). I am buying Plot against America this week. Maybe I can even sneak in some time for Three Men in a Boat. But first, I have to finish Jonathan Strange and Mr.Norrell.
