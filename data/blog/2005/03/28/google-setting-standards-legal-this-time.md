A [number of lawsuits](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/27/technology/27cnd-google.html?ex=1269579600&en=14d696a9591259e4&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland) involving [Google](http://www.google.com) could

1\) hurt the company  
2\) set legal standards for the rest.

Like this. Putting up thumbnails of high quality pictures on other websites is considered [fair use](http://www.gigalaw.com/articles/2002-all/baroni-2002-03-all.html). But, how big can the thumbnails be? According to [Joi Ito’s](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2005/03/28/google_lawsuits_guiding_the_way.html) web, Google uses 150×150, so that’s probably fair. If not, hey someone will sue them, and they’ll figure out.
