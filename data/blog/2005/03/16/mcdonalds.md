McDonald’s is looking into [outsourcing it’s drive through operations](http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/001193.html) to [professionally run call-centers](http://msnbc.msn.com/id/7149812/).

> “If you’re in L.A…. and you hear a person with a North Dakota accent taking your order, you’ll know what we’re up to,” McDonald’s Chief Executive Jim Skinner told analysts at the Bear Stearns Retail, Restaurants &amp; Apparel Conference in New York.

I am sure a North Indian accent isn’t that far behind. At least the girls from Bangalore won’t proffer disbelieving “Huhs”, when I ask for a Big Mac with everything but the meat.
