You get asked certain hard to answer questions a lot if you are Tamil. Like why are [your](http://www.maalaimalar.com/images/cine/star/Gallery/14/03kushbu.jpg) [film ](http://www.maalaimalar.com/images/cine/star/Gallery/11/jothika20.jpg)[actresses ](http://www.maalaimalar.com/images/cine/star/Gallery/19/mumthaj09.jpg) \[insert favorite euphemism for *fat* here\]? A matter of preference, you think? Good guess, but you are dead wrong. The real answer is a ruthless clan of \[insert second favorite euphemism for *fat* here\] actresses, operating in and around Madras. Don't believe me? Read on.

Take the case of [Rahasya](http://thatstamil.indiainfo.com/images26/cinema/ragasya1-400.jpg), a svelte, slim, pretty (ok, ok, I'll take that back) vamp. She appeared first in an item number in Kamalhassan's remake of Munna Bhai MBBS, and has fast become the go-to girl for one-song numbers in Tamil. Popular enough, that the cabal started taking note. So, when she went to a bar in the city to chill out and practice a dance move or two, she had a surprise in store.

As she is dancing, she feels something strike her from behind. Turning around, she sees the culprit: the corpulent behind of [Kiran](http://www.maalaimalar.com/images/cine/star/Gallery/13/kiran52.jpg), rumored to be pretty high up in the hierarchy of the clan. *Probably an accident* she assumes, and continues dancing. Bad assumption. Soon, strike two. With a lot more intensity, causing her to almost fall. “What the …”, she turns around and asks in whatever language she speaks. Bad move again. You never talk back to a cabalite.

[Kiran ](http://www.maalaimalar.com/images/cine/star/Gallery/13/kiran83.jpg)calls for reinforcements. Enter Sangavi. [In ](http://thirai.ambalam.com/star-file/2002/february/sangavi-1.jpg)and [out ](http://thirai.ambalam.com/star-file/2000/December/sangavi2.jpg)of the cabal, but never so out to make the cabal angry. Together they do their thing to Rahasya: mostly standard cabal operating procedure, just falling on the victim from different angles. It can be pretty effective: When you have two 300lb objects falling on you from different directions simultaneously, it tends to hurt.

Last I heard, Rahasya is now on a diet consisting exclusively of things rich in saturated fat (no trans fat though: that is bad). “Maybe,” she was heard crowing, “I will become a cabalite one day.” Sure.

PS: What about [Simran](http://www.maalaimalar.com/images/cine/star/Gallery/27/simran24.jpg), you ask? Well asked wise reader. Answer: [This](http://www.maalaimalar.com/images/cine/star/Gallery/27/simran101.jpg).

PPS: Does this sound like a stupid fantasy of a deluded engineer? Again, good thinking. But I have a link to prove this happened. And they are far more descriptive than I am. Although, they have a question mark at the end of the page title, which makes you wonder if they are speculating …, but hey, no one's imagination is *that* good.
