The Man Booker [longlist](http://www.themanbookerprize.com/pressoffice/release.php?r=11) for 2005 has been announced, and it might well be the [strongest field ever](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/08/11/nbook11.xml&sSheet=/portal/2005/08/11/ixportal.html).

McEwan, Ishuguro and Rusdie are the only ones on the list that I’ve read, and going by [some ](http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/001622.html)of the [reviews ](http://www.thebookstandard.com/bookstandard/reviews/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000928976)reviews [Shalimar the Clown](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0679463356/102-9825982-4304936?v=glance) has been getting, Rushdie’ll probably start out as the favorite. (Not [this one](http://amitavakumar.com/articles/rushdie2.html), though.)

Manish has a typically [comprehensive post ](http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/002004.html) on the Booker longlist at [Sepia Mutiny ](http://www.sepiamutiny.com/). (And don’t forget to read the comments.)
