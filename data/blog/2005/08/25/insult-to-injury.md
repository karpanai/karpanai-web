We were in a little bit of a rush, but I wanted to go into the store “real quick.” After some haggling, I was allowed to go, subject to some rules (*but, of course*). The instructions were fairly clear:

Come back in 10 minutes.

Just buy the ones you want, don't just stand there gawking.

I hurried in, and headed straight for the information counter. A winsome girl gave me smile just as winsome – but I remembered the second rule and asked her in my best business-like tone,

> *“I'm looking for a book called Never Let Me Go.”*
> 
> *“Author?”*
> 
> *“I-s-h-i-g-u-r-o”*
> 
> *“Sorry. Don't have that author.”*

Uh-oh.

> *“What about Smith, Z-a-d-i-e?”*
> 
> *“Book name?”*
> 
> *“On Beauty.”*
> 
> Taps on keyboard, *“Yes, we have.”*

One out of two isn't too bad.

> *“Ok, where is it?”*
> 
> *“No stock.”*
> 
> *“What does ‘we have' mean?”*
> 
> *“Have in database.”*

Damn. I start to walk out disappointed – not smart to sign up to review two books at [Veena's Booker Mela](http://onayahuasca.blogspot.com/2005/08/2005-booker-mela.html) without checking for availability. Just then, the girl calls me,

> *“Sir.”*
> 
> *“Yeah?”*
> 
> *“We currently have a sale. 25% discount on all Danielle Steel books.”*

I wanted to thank her for rubbing it in, but my ten minutes were up.
