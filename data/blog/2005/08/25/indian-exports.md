[Amardeep Singh](http://www.lehigh.edu/~amsp/2005/08/pariah-needs-cummerbund-more.html) points us to a searchable version of [Hobson-Jobson](http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/hobsonjobson/) dictionary, a fascinating glossary of English words with Indian origins. It’s a pity you can’t browse through the dictionary, but hey, you can read Amardeep’s post instead – he lists a lot of everyday English words that trace their roots to an Indian language.

What this means is that [RamaNarayanan](http://www.thenisai.com/tamil/artists/d_rama_narayanan.htm) could make a movie about an anaconda’s affair with Meena, and call it [“Anacondas”](http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/ddsa/getobject_?.a.0:49./projects/artfl0/databases/dicos/philologic/hobson/IMAGE/) without hurting the Tamil names lobby. Sweet.
