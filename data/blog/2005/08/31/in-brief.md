For a change, a fun tag. The goal, inspired by [this](http://newtimes-slo.com/archive/2004-06-10/55_fiction/55_story.html) is to write a short story in 55 words or less. My definition of a short story is wider than yours, so here’s my, um… , effort.

> A blogger dies and goes to heaven. A few weeks into his stay, he runs into [Darwin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin). Talk tended to evolution, naturally.
> 
> He asks Darwin about the only evolution bloggers care about – how people evolve from [Insignificant Microbes](http://www.truthlaidbear.com/ecosystem.php?start=microbe) to [Mortal Humans](http://www.truthlaidbear.com/ecosystem.php) and beyond.
> 
> “Good content,” he replied.
> 
> “Is that all?”
> 
> “And [Intelligent Design](https://stochastica.net/2005/08/22/creationism-by-any-other-name/).”

Thanks [Prash](http://www.prash.net/archives/2005/08/28/my-55-cents/) for the tag (and a neat story!) – I had so much fun doing this. Maybe I’ll do more…

> It was love at first sight – vulnerable me and the irresistible sonofabitch. We went home together that night, getting along fabulously till my sister moved in. She started to like him.

> This morning I wake up, and they’re both gone.
