I kind of knew it the first time I picked up Hamlet. Not to toot my own horn or anything, but it was quite obvious to me after reading the second line of the play, the one that had someone asking someone else to “stand, and unfold yourself” – this book was multidimensional. Deep. Cryptic. It was pregnant with hidden meaning, and if you got a copy with better line spacing than mine, I am quite certain there was a lot that you could have read between the lines.

From cryptic to cryptographic isn't such a big leap, and Clare Asquith has made just that. She thinks, nay, *knows* that Shakespeare was a “subversive who embedded dangerous political messages in his work.”

Not to be judgemental, but here's an example of the *code*:

Makes me yearn for Dan Brown.

Read the whole thing [here.](http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,6109,1557983,00.html) In case you are wondering, I had to do several carefully conducted searches using multiple search engines to sort through all the Salman Rushdie news/profiles/reviews/interviews/conversations before I got to this article.

You're welcome.
