I thought Manoj’s [round up ](http://minorscale.net/index.php/archives/2005/08/17/independence-day-tv/) of Independence Day TV programs in Chennai was neat, until I read the post again and realized he seemed to be dissing Namitha.

I am apalled. Look at her gorgeous, beautiful, pretty, um… face and tell me how someone could be mean enough to make fun of her.
