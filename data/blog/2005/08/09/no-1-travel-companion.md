[The Hindu Literary Review](http://www.hindu.com/lr/2005/08/07/stories/2005080700150300.htm) carries an interview with [Alexander McCall Smith](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-form/102-9825982-4304936), the prolific, self-effacing author of the best light reads out there today. (Jai Arjun writes a neat reco for Smith [here](http://jaiarjun.blogspot.com/2005/06/of-applied-ethics-and-armchair-murder.html))
