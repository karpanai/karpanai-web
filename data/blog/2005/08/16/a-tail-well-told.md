Chris Anderson, editor of the [Wired](http://www.wired.com) wrote an article called [The Long Tail](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/tail.html) last year, where he argued that the future of entertainment lies not in megahits, but in the steady trickle of money from “niche markets at the shallow end of the bitstream.”

The article was received well – so well in fact that Anderson is now turning it into a book, following the lead of [James Surowiecki](http://www.randomhouse.com/features/wisdomofcrowds/author.html) whose book born out of a New Yorker article – [Wisdom of the Crowds](https://stochastica.net/2005/06/22/intelligence-in-numbers/) – was an instant bestseller.

Anderson maintains a [blog on The Long Tail](http://longtail.typepad.com/the_long_tail/), a “public diary on the way to a book.” A blog is a great way to gather information for a book like this – a look at some of the comments on the Long Tail is enough to convince one of this.

And if the book is not a bestseller, I'm sure Anderson won't be too worried. After all, he invented [The Long Tail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Tail).
