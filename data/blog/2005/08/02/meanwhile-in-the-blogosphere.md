[Curious Gawker](http://curiousgawker.blogspot.com) has a [hilarious anecdote](http://curiousgawker.blogspot.com/2005/07/dancing-with-bottom-feeders.html) about applying for an Indian passport. (Link through: [Sepia Mutiny](http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/001921.html#more) ) .

And [Krishnan Menon](http://www.brutalclarity.com/index.php/weblog/more/a_customer_service_story/) chimes in with his own (equally funny) horror story at an Indian Consulate, trying to get a replacement for his damaged passport. A tortuous conversation ensues with the guy at the counter, culminating in this gem:

> “We are very busy right now.”
> 
> “My flight is in 4 days.”
> 
> “Oh.”
> 
> He thought for a bit, and then his eyes lit up.
> 
> “I can give it to you in 6 days.”
> 
> “But I'm leaving in 4! How will I go?”
> 
> “It's only 2 days difference. Change your ticket.”
> 
> “I'll miss my wedding!”
> 
> He grunted, and stood up. Telling me to wait, he consulted a surly looking woman in the back, and they stood there buzzing to each other, ocassionally glancing in my direction. Finally, he made his way back to me.
> 
> “Ok, come back this afternoon. But please do not make a habit of this.”

Reminds me of the time a few friends and I went to a Subway in Orlando, late at night, exhausted. I was the first in line to order.

> “I'll have a footlong veggie, please”
> 
> “We have no wheat bread. Okay?” Y'all, WE HAVE NO WHEAT BREAD IN THE STORE!”
> 
> “Ok.”
> 
> “Whatcha having again?”
> 
> “Umm.. a footlong veggie.”
> 
> “White or Wheat?”

Trick question, you think?

On another note, [DoZ](http://booksmovieslife.blogspot.com) writes an [insightful post](http://booksmovieslife.blogspot.com/2005/07/guilt-or-resentment-lets-flip-coin.html) about guilt, resentment, and master bedrooms. Neat.

 [Manoj](http://www.minorscale.net) [explains why there is more to bags and vegetables](http://minorscale.net/index.php/archives/2005/07/22/124/) than meets the eye.

Meanwhile this writer (I've always wanted to say *that*) lounges lazily, multiple half finished posts be damned.
