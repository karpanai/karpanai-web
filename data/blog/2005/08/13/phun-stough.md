Through [Prufrock’s Page,](http://prufrockspage.blogspot.com/2005/08/tough-enough.html) a link to [this delightful article](http://thestar.com.my/life*/story.asp?file=/2005/8/11/lifefocus/11655292&sec=lifefocus) where Ralph Berry muses on why English pronunciation and spelling hate each other so much.

> I once saw the great Laurence Olivier play Malvolio in Twelfth Night. I had to pay a vast sum for a seat in the front row, so I gazed up at the actor a couple of yards away. In the Garden scene, Malvolio has to say “Cast thy humble slough” (that is, abandon your lowly demeanour, as a snake sloughs off its skin). Olivier’s eyes roamed around the audience, and settled on me. “Cast thy humble, er, sleouwgh? \[slight pause\] sluff?” The audience of 1,500 exploded in laughter as one.
