Rediff has [a slide show](http://specials.rediff.com/news/2005/aug/12sld1.htm) of the “swanky” new terminal at Mumbai's domestic airport, and adds that this is just a taste of things to come.

First [Chennai](http://www.expresstravelandtourism.com/200504/airwaves01.shtml) and now this, so perhaps we'll drop off the bottom of [this list](http://sleepinginairports.com/bestof.htm) soon. As soon as we get rid of the mosquitoes, that is.
