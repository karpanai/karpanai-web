The prestigious annual Indian [National Awards](http://in.rediff.com/movies/2005/jul/13awards.htm) have been announced, and there has been [much](http://minorscale.net/index.php/archives/2005/07/14/spare-us-mishra/) [consternation ](http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2005/jul/13award1.htm)about how things have hit a new low. If you ask me, I think people are over-reacting a bit.

Ok, so [Page 3](https://stochastica.net/2005/03/01/too-much-of-a-good-thing/) was adjudged the best movie of the year. Disappointed? You shouldn’t be. I am quite contented that it was Page 3 and not “[Charas – A Joint Effort](http://downloads.movies.indiatimes.com/movies/charas/index.html)“. I heard it was the runner up. I have to admit though – I am a little disappointed that my personal favorites won nothing. Not [GirlFriend](http://girlfriend.indiatimes.com/). Not [Julie.](http://julie.indiatimes.com/) Not even [ Murder](http://murder.indiatimes.com/). However, I heard that there [may or may not be another movie ](http://indiauncut.blogspot.com/2005/07/is-it-mallika.html)of Ms.Sherawat that might be a contender for some awards next year.

Saif Ali Khan, apparently was the best actor this year. Bad choice, you think? Hah. Just wait till next year, when [Amitabh ](http://minorscale.net/index.php/archives/2005/04/25/black-smell-the-ham/)wins for [Black](https://stochastica.net/2005/04/24/a-bleak-affair/). This decision will look like a masterstroke.

On a side note, if [these](http://indianwriting.blogspot.com/2005/07/on-ash-sallu-tapes.html) [transcripts](http://soniafaleiro.blogspot.com/2005/07/whos-your-daddy.html) had been released in 2004, Salman would’ve walked away with awards in the comic villian category. Hands down.

The best lyricist is Pa. Vijay for his song in Autograph. For a song that starts off so:

> Each flowers (sic!) will tell you…

Naturally. How can you not reward someone that daringly breaks [number agreement](http://leo.stcloudstate.edu/grammar/pronante.html#number) rules in the first line of a song.

All said and done, it wasn’t all that bad, right? About par for the course.

PS: I heard Vidyasagar (*best* music director) called Chitra (*best* playback singer), and asked her “What did we do wrong?” After a long discussion, they concluded that it was just rotten luck.
