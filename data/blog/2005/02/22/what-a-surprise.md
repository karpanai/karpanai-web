Some dude called Jumbo claims that [Nagma](http://images.google.com/images?q=nagma&hl=en&btnG=Google+Search), former hearthrob, has underworld links, and even hid heavy machinery in her not inconsiderable belly and [ helped smuggle it into Karachi to set up a gutka plant](http://www.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=41936). So anyways, an angry Nagma denies the accusation and claims that she was framed, and adds for effect that the girl with underworld links was not her, but a TV actress that shares her name.

Turns out that equally fat (and equally ex) heartthrob [Mumtaz ](http://thatstamil.indiainfo.com/images22/cinema/mumtaj-500a.jpg)used to be called Nagma before [T. Rajendar](http://images.indiaglitz.com/tamil/gallery/movies/veerasaami/veera08072004_1.jpg) (another fat ex-movie maker, music director, cameraman, and yes actor too) rechristened her for the screen. [ Was it her, then?](http://sify.com/entertainment/movies/tamil/fullstory.php?id=13675485)

No, she says. In fact, during the time period in question, she [was in her third grade](http://www.vikatan.com/vc/2005/feb/vc01115.asp). What the heck? I am experiencing a combination of shock, surprise and speechlessness. Mumtaz passed her second grade?
