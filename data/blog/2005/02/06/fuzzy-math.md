 Fact : The Tsunami destroyed homes.

Fact :The Maharashtra Government is destroying homes that encroach on public property.

Conclusion : Tsunami = Maharashtra Government.

Saw this first on [Dilip D'Souza's](http://dcubed.blogspot.com/) blog. Now [the Hindu](http://www.hindu.com/2005/02/05/stories/2005020500611000.htm) carries the same logic. And some people seem to buy into this â€“ caring enough to [write back](http://www.hindu.com/2005/02/07/stories/2005020702051003.htm).

Now without going into whether I think the demolitions are right or wrong, all I can say is these folks may have some trouble with the analytical skills portion of the GRE.
