Insightful reporting from the [Times of India](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1013110.cms):

> “One of Bush’s strongest election planks was immigration, where he scored over challenger John Kerry particularly on the outsourcing issue.”

 “Strongest plank?” Really? So the 43 total seconds that the candidates spent on immigration reform was actually responsible for Bush’s win. How could I have missed that?
