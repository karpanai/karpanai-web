 Newsweek has[ this article](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6884904/site/newsweek/) on evolution and “Intelligent Design – a critique of evolution couched in the language of science.”

I am not sure why evolution *[made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6884904/site/newsweek/page/3/)*  – the formation of life might have been a chemical reaction, but it was a chemical reaction that required a number of parameters to be just perfect before it could begin.

Science will probably be never be able to convincingly explain how this set of circumstances came about – it requires a little bit of *faith*. Literal interpretation of religious texts is fraught with peril because most such works are allegorical, but a little bit of symbolic license and you can reconcile religion with science. Like [this article on the ten avatars of Vishnu](http://www.srivaishnavam.com/stotras/dasavatharam_meaning.htm).
