 Sujatha [writes](http://www.vikatan.com/av/2005/feb/13022005/av0903.asp) (link requires registration) about how some commonly used English words have been transmogrified into Tamil, with bizarre consequences.

An “assault” job, is a job done effortlessly, nonchalantly. You can do such things only if you are unperturbed by the “tilers” – unimportant pretenders.

When you have a feeling” for someone you are actually upset.And then the old classic – repair* something and it is broken – you probably need a *“drinks*” or two to drown your *feelings*.

Another reason to [let the language grow](http://stochastica.blogspot.com/2005/01/fools-paradise.html). A few centuries from now a Tamil dictionary will list these as Tamil words (with an quick little etymological bow to English…)
