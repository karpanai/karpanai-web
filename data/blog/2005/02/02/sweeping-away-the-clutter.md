 Anyone remember how search pages used to look before Google? All of them ([Altavista](http://www.altavista.com/), [MSN](http://search.msn.com/), [Yahoo](http://search.yahoo.com/), [AskJeeves](http://www.askjeeves.com/)) look the same now – simple and uncluttered. Guess Google made functional a cool thing. [MSN.com: A letter from Bill Gates](http://specials.msn.com/letter/billgates.html)

But till Google finishes the [library project](http://print.google.com/), [A9](http://www.a9.com/) will continue to be my favorite. [Search Inside the Book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/10197021/104-2516002-2631927) is the best thing in search since… Google.
