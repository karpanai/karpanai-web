 [From The Washington Post Style Invitational …](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A17013-2004Nov27.html), almost a classic 🙂

> “Jack,” said Jill, “I’m on the pill,  
> With condoms don’t you bother.”  
> Jack believed, but was deceived.  
> Now Jack’s a brand-new father.

I also liked this one… an [obit-poem](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A47769-2005Jan29.html) for [Joseph Zimmerman](http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0921429.html) (who invented the answering machine):

> *‘Hi, this is St. Peter. I’m out at the moment  
> So leave me your name at the bell.’  
> ‘This is Zimmerman, Joseph. I made this machine,  
> I’m so glad to reach you and not Hell.”*
