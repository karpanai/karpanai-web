 ![ ](http://www.erudita.com/images/blog/ilayaraja_thiruvasagam.jpg)I listened to [Uravugal Thodarkathai ](http://www.erudita.com/images/blog/uravugal.rm)again today. Who could have known? That a mere song could move you, hard-nosed and all that, so much. Every chord emotional, every riff tugging at heart strings. That malleable music existed, music that could blend in with whatever you were feeling. A frenzied friend by your side, dragging your mind through an emotional kaleidoscope.

Strangely, all that remains at the end is contentment; joy. And the urge to rewind, replay. A little overwhelmed: At this rate, I am never going to go through the hundred other songs that do similar things to my brain. And as always, shock: That [one man](http://www.raaja.com/) could compose all of this in one lifetime.

Now, this attempt at rendering the [Thiruvasakam ](http://siddhanta.shaivam.org/thiru8.html)– an epic Saivite poem – as “[Thiruvasakam in symphony](http://www.chennaionline.com/colnews/newsitem.asp?NEWSID=%7BC8ABF6D6-EB05-428E-B7A5-4439663DF2EA%7D&CATEGORYNAME=Tamil+Nadu)“. Sixty year old man, at the twilight of his career, reduced to desperately seeking recognition that he so richly deserves. I just wish I could go up to him and tell him that after one Uravugal Thodarkathai, the rest is all fluff.
