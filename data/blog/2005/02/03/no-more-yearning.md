 Boy, am I light on my feet today or what. Lavanya is back. After some frantic foraging through her luggage, and scattering a couple of sarees (*with intricate work!*), I managed to locate a box full of Aavin Pal Kova. Yes, *the* Pal Kova. If you have never tried it, I pity you. Yeah, it really *is*that good. I hurriedly stuffed myself, dropping a few morsels on the sarees-with-intricate work. And finally stopped when I located part of the loot: I am gonna be a good boy, coz she tells me there are more books to come ðŸ™‚ Boy, am I light on my feet today or what.
