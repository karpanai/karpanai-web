Incogruous as it may sound, “*[Book Millionaire](http://www.bookmillionaire.com/index.html)*,” a soon to be aired reality show on TV will involve writers – as *contestants*. Wannabe writers, who dream “of seeing their book ideas become published and being the next author launched to best selling and celebrity status,” can audition. And thankfully enough, “Book Millionaire will not be about watching people sit around writing books.” See, that would’ve been boring, unless the contestants are encouraged to follow in the footsteps of [Lawerence and Hugo](http://getthenews.net/Sam/ablankpage.htm) and write in the nude.

> Eight people with dreams of seeing their book ideas become published and being the next author launched to best selling and celebrity status will meet our Publishing Committee during August/September 2005 to start filming of Book Millionaire Reality TV Show. Book Millionaire will begin airing nationally during Fall 2005 television season.

I have a feeling [Preethi Nair](http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/001330.html) will be there.
