Yum is a cup of tea from the Nescafe automatic vending machines in India. In Cardamom and Ginger flavors. Especially the one inside a decrepit plaza on Cathedral road. Tired from following Lavanya around as she shopped for clothes, the *yelakka* tea that the young boy filled into a plastic cup, turning the tap off with a stylish flourish was, well, *yum*.

Yum is [Haagen Dazs Mango](http://www.haagendazs.com/segicd.do?productId=2). Surely, a product from paradise. [Cold Stone Creamery](http://www.coldstonecreamery.com/main/index.asp), you pale in comparison. But don’t worry, not too pale.

Yum is the Sambar from [Annapurna ](http://www.sreeannapoorna.com/restaurant.html)in Coimbatore. Matchless. Sorry Mom.

Yum is the [Bhaingan Bhartha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarian_diet) that Lavanya makes. Incomparable. Transcendent. [And all this.](http://thesaurus.reference.com/search?q=best)

Yum is a [Rahul Dravid](http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/PLAYERS/IND/D/DRAVID_R_06002281/) [on drive](http://www.cricinfo.com/perl/picture.cgi/023233). Yummier was a wristy [Azharuddin ](http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/PLAYERS/IND/A/AZHARUDDIN_M_06001774/)[shot](http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/PICTURES/DB/121997/000376.jpg). But the [match fixing](http://www.outlookindia.com/full.asp?fodname=20050418&fname=Controversy&sid=1) left a bad taste in your mouth. Yummiest is a [Sachin Tendulkar](http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/PLAYERS/IND/T/TENDULKAR_SR_06001934/) [straight drive](http://www.cricinfo.com/perl/picture.cgi/043542). And he knows it – watching him hold a pose after is a delight.

Yum is [Mysore Pak ](http://www.somacon.com/cookbook/pictures/mysorepak_small.jpg)by Mom. [Krishna sweets](http://www.srikrishnasweets.com/) can try all they want. Yum is also how she pronounces the letter M. I used to pronounce it Yum too, till Mrs. D’Souza told me otherwise in second grade. It was my mom’s money that sent me to that school so that I could be snooty and correct her.
