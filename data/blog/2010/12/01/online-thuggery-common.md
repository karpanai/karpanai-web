David Segal’s profile of an unscrupulous online operator in the New York Times [is the most fun story I’ve read in a long time](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/28/business/28borker.html?pagewanted=all). Deeper implications aside, how can a story with lines like this one not be fun?

> “Do you think I would think twice about urinating all over your frame and then returning it? Common.” \[[NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/28/business/28borker.html?pagewanted=all)\]

The villain of the piece is Vitaly Borker (“[thuggish Russia born Brooklynite](http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2010/11/vitaly_borker_t.php)“) who runs his online operation in a manner familar to anyone that has shopped for groceries in India. It is a hilarious read that leaves you feeling slightly queasy at the end.

> “The customer is always right — not here, you understand?” he says, raising his voice. “I hate that phrase — the customer is always right. Why is the merchant always wrong? Can the customer ever be wrong? Is that not possible?”

> The next day, a man named Tony Russo called to say that DecorMyEyes had run out of the Ciba Visions. Pick another brand, he advised a little brusquely.
> 
> “I told him that I didn’t want another brand,” recalls Ms. Rodriguez, who lives in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. “And I asked for a refund. He got rude, really obnoxious. ‘What’s the big deal? Choose another brand!’ “
> 
> With the contacts issue unresolved, her eyeglasses arrived two days later. But the frames appeared to be counterfeits and Ms. Rodriguez, a lifelong fan of Lafont, remembers that even the case seemed fake.
> 
> Soon after, she discovered that DecorMyEyes had charged her $487 — or an extra $125. When she and Mr. Russo spoke again, she asked about the overcharge and said she would return the frames.
> 
> “What the hell am I supposed to do with these glasses?” she recalls Mr. Russo shouting. “I ordered them from France specifically for you!”
> 
> “I’m going to contact my credit card company,” she told him, “and dispute the charge.”
> 
> Until that moment, Mr. Russo was merely ornery. Now he erupted.
> 
> “Listen, bitch,” he fumed, according to Ms. Rodriguez. “I know your address. I’m one bridge over” — a reference, it turned out, to the company’s office in Brooklyn. Then, she said, he threatened to find her and commit an act of sexual violence too graphic to describe in a newspaper. \[[NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/28/business/28borker.html?_r=1&pagewanted=print)\]
